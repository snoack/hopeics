DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Bruce Kushnick\n\nAmerica was supposed to be a fiber 
 optic nation and the telecom pipes were supposed to be open to all forms o
 f competition. Customers paid over half a trillion dollars to make this ha
 ppen by 2018 - and that’s the low number. Through mergers and the takeov
 er of the FCC and some state commissions\, today there are only a few comp
 anies that have taken control of most of America’s broadband\, Internet\
 , cable TV\, phone\, satellite\, and wireless services. How do we fix net 
 neutrality\, get back our privacy\, stop the overcharging\, and finally ge
 t gig speeds and open pipes? Hear how to hold them accountable for their m
 isdeeds and take the final step: It’s time to break up AT&T\, Verizon\, 
 and the cable companies... again.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mitch Altman\n\nThis is an inexpensive Arduino-compat
 ible musical instrument with a touch keyboard\, amp\, and speaker that any
 one can make. It is easy to build - designed for total beginners to learn 
 to solder together. It’s a very low cost method for making music/sound/n
 oise\, and a fun way to learn digital signal processing (DSP) for generati
 ng music/sound/noise. This talk will show beginners how the ArduTouch musi
 c synthesizer kit makes use of DSP to create its large diversity of music/
 sound/noise. Mitch will also explain how the touch keyboard works\, as wel
 l as the cheap amplifier/speaker built into the board. The ArduTouch Ardui
 no library works on any Arduino board and Mitch will demonstrate how to ma
 ke use of this library to create your own unique synthesizers - both by ha
 cking some of the many examples it comes with\, or by making use of its hi
 gh-level functions. This talk will also include a demo of some of the musi
 c the ArduTouch can make\, as well as some wonderful nasty noise!

 is a community-driven knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavio
 r\, reflecting the various phases of an adversary’s life cycle and the p
 latforms they are known to target. By scoping the wide breadth of the MITR
 E ATT&CK matrix to focus initially on the techniques used by threat actors
  you specifically care about\, you can help the defenders create more usef
 ul and impactful detections first. Once you start emulating the appropriat
 e threat actors\, you can practice your defenses in a scenario that’s mo
 re realistic and applicable without the need for an actual intrusion. The 
 speakers are providing a process and a case study of APT3 - a China-based 
 threat group - for how to go from finding threat intelligence\, sifting th
 rough it for actionable techniques\, creating emulation plans\, discoverin
 g how to emulate different techniques... to actually operating on a networ
 k. They are also providing a beginning "cheat sheet" for this actor to giv
 e a starting point for red and blue teams to accomplish these techniques i
 n their own environment without the need to build their own tooling.

 a small budget and without the infrastructure requirements of large scale 
 production. Together with open lab hardware and accessible microcontroller

 -cost software-defined radios (SDRs) coupled with today’s faster memory-
 enhanced computers allow us to record not just individual signals from one
  radio station at a time\, but an entire broadcast band - a wide swath of 
 frequencies - all at once. Each recording from a particular day and time c
 an easily contain dozens\, if not hundreds\, of stations broadcasting and 
 communicating simultaneously. Later\, via a software-defined radio applica
 tion\, recordings can be tuned and listened to (decoded) as if they were l
 ive. This talk will discuss how you can build your own "radio time machine
 " which supports such virtual time shifts by utilizing an inexpensive ($25
 -$100) SDR\, and also show how you can - for free - virtually "travel" thr

  modern life\, there is a concern over catastrophic events that could have
  the potential to disrupt and alter life as we know it. The threats of EMP
  (electromagnetic pulse) and CME (coronal mass discharge) are real and\, s
 hould they occur\, the results would impact the lives of millions. The phy
 sics behind these threats are analyzed\, their effects and potential for d
 amage estimated\, and means to protect against them examined. Additionally
 \, the use of EMP as a weapon is analyzed from a strategic standpoint\, an
 d non-nuclear threats to the electrical grid considered.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Anna Bernardi\, Filippo Valsorda\n\nAntonio Marzi die
 d in 2007\, leaving behind dozens of encrypted notes and a partial key. Du
 ring World War II\, he chose to work with the British Special Operations E
 xecutive and was parachuted into Italian territory under German occupation
 . There he transmitted detailed military-related dispatches in encrypted f
 orm. This was not modern cryptography\, nor Enigma\, but the kind that was
  doable on the field with pen and paper. Specifically\, they used poem cod
 es\, as "Between Silk and Cyanide" tells us: a double columnar transpositi
 on cipher that scrambles the order of the letters. Marzi sent the notes to
  an Italian professor and there they stayed undeciphered until 2013. Anna 
 and Filippo obtained copies of the notes and exploited one of the mortal s
 ins of cryptography\, key reuse\, to reconstruct the key. (Armin Krauss in
 dependently decrypted the notes in the same year.) A number of them were i
 ndecipherable due to encryption mistakes made in the field. During the war
 \, entire departments hacked away at these ciphertexts\, but today compute
 rs make easy work of them. This talk will explore how they went from recog
 nizing the code\, to reconstructing the key (partially thanks to little ha
 ndwritten dots)\, to the contents of the notes.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: David Noever\n\nAs the biggest public domain email da
 tabase\, the Enron email corpus details financial deception in the world
 ’s largest energy trading company and\, at the time in 2002\, triggered 
 the most costly U.S. bankruptcy and its most massive audit failure. What c
 an Enron tell us today? This talk will invite fresh perspective on how ema
 il has (and has not) changed since 2002. Can modern forensic methods find 
 where any new email bodies are buried\, even when scanning through the evi
 dence of a previously closed case? The presentation highlights some funny 
 and poignant examples of how humans in business suits write to each other 
 when planning mischief. For the previous six years prior to its failure\, 
 Fortune Magazine had named Enron as "America’s most innovative company."
  Enron’s former chief financial officer now lectures profitably to busin
 ess groups and hedge funds using a new self-appointed title of "chief loop
 hole officer." More than 3\,000 studies have dissected Enron’s email\, b
 ut have failed to uncover some of its more fascinating forensic artifacts.
  Nearly two decades later\, we revisit this trove to discover what modern 
 tools can do with it. For instance\, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Co
 mmission (FERC) originally released two terabytes (1.6 million emails and 
 attachments)\, they claimed to have stripped all personal information. Yet
  a modern machine learning pipeline in 2018 can identify almost 50\,000 pr
 eviously unreported instances\, including credit card numbers\, bank accou
 nts\, and additional evidence that potentially harms the 99 percent of Enr
 on employees who were never charged. At least one example of detectable ma
 lware is still included in the official Enron corpus (called "Joke-StressR
 elief") along with 231 other executables which continue to accompany each 
 download. This talk will further investigate whether by using email traffi
 c alone\, machine learning can predict all of the (eventually charged) per
 sons of interest. It will discuss how Hadoop distributed processing on mul
 tiple\, clustered virtual machines was deployed. More than 50 algorithms w
 ere analyzed for both accuracy (90 plus percent) and execution times. In c
 ompliance with new (June 2018) European privacy rules for explainable arti
 ficial intelligence\, each algorithmic decision was reduced to human-under
 standable rules and rank order to define which email factors might prove m
 ost predictive to future fraud and conspiracy investigations.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Luca Follis\n\nWhile state hacking is a powerful weap
 on for authoritarian regimes\, it has an erosive effect on democratic stat
 es. Hacking is advantageous for authoritarian governments that need to ret
 ain domestic control\, monitor and disturb dissent\, attack aggressors\, a
 nd project force internationally. State hacking is bad because it is delet
 erious to the legitimacy of the democratic state\, the legal system\, "eth
 ical" capitalism\, and the democratic process itself. In this talk\, the a
 rgument is presented that state hacking is bad for democratic elections\, 
 the integrity of the security services\, transparency in government\, priv
 acy for the individual\, the separation of public and private militaries\,
  the judicial system\, and the development of ethical cybersecurity practi
 ces. Such hacking is a short circuit in the rule of law and undermines the
  machinery of democracy. State hacking is bad because it provides unparall
 eled advantage to rulemakers while delegitimizing the citizen led governme

 e a significant impact on people’s ability to exercise their rights to f
 reedom of expression and privacy. Yet companies aren’t doing enough to p
 rotect these rights. How can they do better and how can we incentivize the
 m to move in the right direction? Ranking Digital Rights\, a nonprofit res
 earch initiative\, works with an international network of partners to set 
 global standards for how companies in the information and communication te
 chnology sector should respect freedom of expression and privacy. Its annu
 al corporate accountability index ranks 22 companies on a set of indicator
 s evaluating how transparent companies are about their commitments and pol
 icies affecting human rights. This talk will give an overview of how the c
 orporate accountability index lays out a road map for companies to improve
  their human rights standards. Laura will provide highlights from the rece
 ntly launched 2018 index\, showing where companies are beginning to be mor
 e transparent about their practices - things like content moderation polic
 ies and practices for handling user information - and where there are stil
 l significant gaps in disclosure that leave users in the dark.

  battle which resulted in the "forum bar" that helped protect Love. But th

 terprises in 2018. This will be a candid\, detailed\, step-by-step how-to 
 attack chain walkthrough\, explaining how and why the attacks work\, and w
 hat steps can be taken to proactively defend against them. Participants wi
 ll walk away with highly actionable tasks to immediately take to work on M

 little to no hit on their budgets\, but also inherently render future pene
 tration tests more cost-effective by eliminating potential "cheap shots" t
 hat pentesters love to take. They will also\, of course\, walk away with t

 l real voting systems used in U.S. elections. Many exploitable vulnerabili

  advantage of cross modulation\, the first crowd-funded HAARP experiment\,
  and the first SSTV image broadcast simultaneously with transmissions that

 quip that the day’s bonkers headlines are the result of a Marvel-esque p
 lot twist that has transported us into a parallel universe. But of course\
 , powerful forces have been laying the groundwork for a long time. Network
 ed authoritarianism is a political system that leverages information and c
 ommunications technologies (ICTs) and media regulation to carefully contro
 l the expression of dissent in a way that gives the impression of limited 
 freedom of expression without allowing dissent to gain traction. Networked
  authoritarianism combines strategies and tactics from the surveillance ca
 pitalism of Silicon Valley and from the information controls practiced by 
 illiberal regimes around the world to create strategic infrastructures to 
 control information flows domestically and to intervene in global media sy
 stems. The democratic regression and rise of ethno-nationalism around the 
 world is directly linked to networked authoritarianism. How did we get to

  to facial recognition\, law enforcement agencies have sweeping and unprec

 gely left in the dark about law enforcement and their activities. In this 
 political context\, it’s on the people to hold police accountable\, and 
 surveillance technology and data collection are methods that should not be
  unilaterally in the hands of law enforcement. OpenOversight is a project 
 developed by data liberation collective Lucy Parsons Labs that consolidate
 s police information from public records\, public submissions\, and web sc
 raping into an open-source\, community governed database. In this session\

 it’s the meat and potatoes of our jobs. And for others\, digital securit

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Micah Lee\n\n"If you’re serious about security\, Qu
 bes OS is the best OS available today\," says NSA whistleblower Edward Sno
 wden. "It’s what I use\, and free." In most operating systems like Windo
 ws\, macOS\, and all Linux distributions\, all it takes is one mistake - o
 pen the wrong PDF\, plug in the wrong USB stick\, "curl | bash" the wrong 
 URL - and it’s game over. Even without root\, the attacker can access al
 l of your data\, take screenshots\, listen through your mic\, watch you th
 rough your webcam\, and get persistence to spy on you in the future. Qubes
  OS aims to be a reasonably secure operating system that doesn’t have th
 is problem. In Qubes\, your host machine runs a thin layer of software for
  managing a graphical desktop environment and all other software is compar
 tmentalized in separate virtual machines\, with strict controls on what ha
 rdware they can access and how they can communicate\, all while being usab
 le enough to run as your daily OS. In this talk\, Micah will show off some
  of the cool things that this approach makes possible\, like opening email
  attachments in "disposable VMs\," managing anonymous identities\, keeping
  secrets like password databases\, PGP keys\, and sensitive documents stor
 ed in vaults without Internet access\, and much more. Beginners are welcom

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Maggie Mayhem\n\nDigital media and communications tec
 hnologies have been a critical component in improving the working conditio
 ns\, health\, and safety of sex workers in many ways. Message boards and t
 hriving social media communities created strong communication networks whe
 re lifesaving information such as bad dates could be disseminated among pe
 er networks to protect those in the sex trade from harm and find supportiv
 e allies. In recent years\, sex worker rights have been systematically ero
 ded in the name of combating human trafficking\, despite a lack of evidenc
 e to justify these actions and the fallout they cause. The recent passage 
 of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) not only continues this d
 angerous trend\, it places human trafficking victims at greater risk and j
 eopardizes Internet freedom for all by eliminating Section 230 of the Comm
 unications Decency Act. With online platforms open to civil and criminal l
 iability for third party content\, it is inevitable that mass censorship w
 ill follow and marginalized voices will face the steepest penalties.

 e protector of freedom! It’s heard frequently in hacker circles\, echoin
 g like a prayer in a church. He’s a freedom fighter\, standing for the A
 merican ideal\, codified in the Constitution. The state apparatus\, not Sn

 s co-created by the late Aaron Swartz and first announced at HOPE four yea

 cation available over a Tor onion service. In the past two years\, adoptio
 n has increased to include most major new organizations\, including The As
 sociated Press\, USA Today\, and The Wall Street Journal. This talk will c
 over the challenges SecureDrop administrators\, journalists\, and sources 
 are facing\, how SecureDrop has been scaled to more organizations\, and pr
 ogress in developing new tools for journalists to work with leaked documen
 ts\, including a Qubes OS-based workstation. In the Trump era - during whi
 ch the Department of Justice has issued a crackdown on whistleblowing in r
 esponse to the current epidemic of leaks from the White House - secure com

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jonah Bossewitch\n\nSurveillance psychiatry is an eme
 rging practice which seeks to predict and prevent mental illness across a 
 broad population by using algorithms and big data. A new generation of dig
 ital systems for policing normal are currently in beta and will soon enabl
 e authorities to control all modes of social deviance and protest. Electro
 nic health records\, data mining social networks\, and even algorithmicall
 y classifying video surveillance will significantly amplify this approach.
  Researchers are claiming they can diagnose depression based on the color 
 and saturation of photos in your Instagram feed - and predict manic episod
 es based on your Facebook status updates.  Corporations and governments ar
 e salivating at the prospect of identifying vulnerability and dissent. Alt
 hough they will carefully use the language of suicide and violence prevent
 ion\, these lines are not so clear. When algorithms are scrutinizing our t
 weets to determine who is crazy\, it will become increasingly difficult to
  avoid a diagnosis.  But there is hope. In this millennium\, a new wave of
  mad resistance has emerged - the Mad Underground\, a thriving network of 
 mental health activists who are developing innovative strategies for resis
 ting psychiatric domination and creating new models of community driven em
 otional support. By listening to their voices and understanding their visi
 ons\, we can diffuse the menacing time bomb of big data surveillance psych
 iatry before it explodes\, putting the depths of our emotions in the realm
  of public consumption and subjecting us to new forms of oppression.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: 'Da Beave'\, 'Faux Real'\n\nIt has been said that Twi

 , politicians\, and government agencies are anxious and uncertain of what 
 may come: "How might another nation influence our election?" "Might the po
 tential for electoral interference persuade some politicians to preemptive
 ly ‘get on board’ with those who may influence the political outcomes?
 " The torrent of news broadcasts and research publications on the subjects
  of social media manipulation have led to greater confusion in some respec
 ts. This talk covers aggressive research conducted over the last year focu
 sing on bots\, fake news\, and hate speech on Twitter. This "aggressive re
 search" uses methods and techniques that are directly at odds with the Twi
 tter ToS. To best understand the motives and techniques of your adversary\
 , it’s sometimes best to walk their shoes. Using and abusing Twitter API
 \, using automation to engage suspicious accounts without using the API\, 
 and engaging in "nontraditional" data collection methods (i.e.\, "social e
 ngineering")\, 'Da Beave' and 'Faux Real' have been collecting and analyzi
 ng a wide range of data related to their targets. The methods employed hav
 e enabled them to gain a wider perspective than any amount of social media
  data alone could provide\, and these techniques have allowed them to brin
 g some of the "trolls" and "bots" out of the dark and into the daylight. T
 his talk covers what they did and how they did it. Source code will be rel

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Alexandra Ellerbeck\, Camille Fassett\n\nLast August\
 , a coalition of more than two dozen organizations dedicated to press free
 dom came together to launch the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker\, a website tha
 t systematically documents press freedom violations in the United States. 
 When the tracker was launched\, it was never anticipated that more than 10
 0 cases would be logged in the first year. These cases show that Trump’s
  heated rhetoric in D.C. is far from the only press freedom story. Instead
 \, journalists face obstacles in courtrooms\, city halls\, and protests. I
 nformation from the tracker has already identified concerning patterns\, s
 uch as the fact that two-thirds of journalists arrested in 2017 were caugh
 t up when police used a controversial tactic known as "kettling." It still
  remains to be seen how much of Trump’s legal threats to journalists are
  bluster\, but the press freedom tracker is rigorously documenting them\, 
 along with the myriad of other threats that often go overlooked.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Regina R. Monaco\n\nA brain machine interface (BMI) i
 s an electrical device that can be used for recording neuronal information

 semi-invasive\, and non-invasive. Non-invasive BMI devices record neural s
 ignals from the surface of the scalp\, such as electroencephalograms (EEG)
 . Semi-invasive BMI devices record from just underneath the scalp (ECoG)\,
  and do not penetrate the brain. Invasive BMI\, such as an implanted micro
 electrode array and electrode dust\, penetrate the brain and record signal
 s directly from neurons. Their purpose? To attempt to communicate directly
  with your brain. Although BMIs provide for many benefits\, such as allowi
 ng patients with locked-in syndrome to communicate with the world or quadr
 iplegics the ability to interact with the world\, people have to understan
 d communication happens in both directions. It serves as an output device\
 , however\, as in the use case for robotic control\, it can serve as a rec
 eiver. If put in the wrong hands\, others can manipulate the very organ th
 at makes you\, you. Is control of your mind a reasonable outcome to protec
 t against? No group in our society is more equipped to answer this questio
 n\, more able to understand this technology\, more qualified to call BS\, 
 and more poised to protect us from this unprecedented privacy intrusion th
 an hackers. We will also be the group poised and able to find bugs in the 
 OS\, demonstrate how these devices can be hacked\, repurpose them to show 
 how they may do the unexpected\, and - perhaps most importantly - engineer
  and integrate controls and limits\, discover critical security vulnerabil
 ities\, and make them clear to the public. The only safety we and the publ
 ic have between us and corporate/government misuse of these devices is the
  curious\, tenacious\, independent\, outspoken\, and resourceful hacker. T
 his talk will discuss technical issues in the design of a BMI - how are mu
 ltiple signal channels read\, how is noise in the system dealt with\, how 
 signaling to and from neurons ("neural code") is understood\, how security
  is currently implemented (clue: it’s not)\, and what the implications o
 f this technology are (clues: far-reaching\, invasive\, privacy-destroying
 ).

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Glenn Willen\n\nIt sure seems like everybody wants a 
 blockchain these days\, doesn’t it? It started with finance\, but now we
  have blockchain for books\, airlines\, advertising\, clinical trials\, en
 ergy... and that’s just the first two pages of Google hits. But why does
  everybody want a blockchain? There’s a ton of a lot of blockchain hype 
 right now\, and frankly\, 95 percent of proposed blockchain projects are c
 rap. So what precisely is a blockchain\, and why is it useful? Where did i
 t come from\, what is it good for\, and - more importantly - what is it to
 tally garbage at? And what kinds of bullshit are people trying to use it f
 or that just doesn’t make any goddamned sense? Glenn is here to tell you
  exactly why your blockchain sucks.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Michael "Sveder" Sverdlin\n\nMore and more people\, h
 ackers included\, are allowing IoT devices into their homes\, while simult
 aneously not a week goes by without a new IoT botnet or an attack on and i
 nvolving IoT devices. Time to talk about what the paranoid of us already k
 now - how to live with your IoT roommates and keep your privacy\, security
 \, and sanity. Michael will go through the story of his smart water heater
  and how he’s slowly but surely making it more hacker friendly - from re
 placing its permission hungry app\, to inspecting the software and the rem
 ote API it insecurely communicates with\, and finally physically taking it
  apart in order to make sure it doesn’t have added "features." The talk 
 will include technical details about his device\, but more importantly it 
 will contain strategies and ownership tips that will work on any other. Io
 T devices are moving in - will you be prepared?
